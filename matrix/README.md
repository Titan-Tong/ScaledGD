The codes implement the experiments described in the paper [Accelerating Ill-Conditioned Low-Rank Matrix Estimation via Scaled Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08898), for matrix sensing, matrix completion, robust PCA, Hankel matrix completion respectively.

Each file can run directly in MATLAB:
MS.m, RPCA.m, MC.m, HankelMC.m -> Figure 2,
MS_noise.m, RPCA_noise.m, MC_noise.m, HankelMC_noise.m -> Figure 3, 
MC_stepsizes.m -> Figure 4,
MS_time.m -> Figure 5, MC_time.m -> Figure 6.
