The codes implement the experiments described in the paper [Scaling and Scalability: Provable Nonconvex Low-Rank Tensor Estimation from Incomplete Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14526), for tensor completion under different condition numbers and noise levels. 

Each file can run directly in MATLAB equipped with [Tensor Toolbox](https://www.tensortoolbox.org):  
TC.m -> Figure 4, TC_randinit.m -> Figure 5, TC_noise.m -> Figure 6.
